          <h2>COMMUNICATION BEYOND WORDS</h2>
          
          <div class="intro">
            Communication is mode of transferring information to another. 
            As social beings , communication is inevitable in our daily lives.
            <br>
            This could be through many forms,verbal communication is the most common all.
            <br><br>
            But its well known that <b> words only go so far .</b>

            which is where other modes and levels of communication take over the game :)
        </div>

            <h3 class="head1">1) Communication beyond<div class="specific">LANGUAGE</div></h3><br>
            <p>
                Verbal communication using language is something understood by only few.
                <br>But there is one such breaks the barriers of language which is none other than . . ART
                  
            </p>
                
                <h4>ART FORMS:-</h4>
                
        <div class="definition">
             
    
                 Art is a special tool that connects people beyond the boundaries of creed , origin and language.
            
        </div> 
                
                <p> EXAMPLES:-
                 <br>
                  <ul>
                    (unlike verbal communication , which requires one to know a language)
                 <br>
                       <li>A Painting's beauty communicates beyond language .</li> 
                 <br>
                   <li> A Sportsman's team-spirit can communicate among a mix of players from all across earth.
                        <br><br>
                (They need not know the language to play a team sport , sports have been known to bring peace between rival countries).</li><br>
                 When global leaders are unable to communicate peace , when tension rises ,a good game played between the countries does a <i> hidden job </i>which we're unable to appreciate.
                  <br><br>
                 When the countries are seen to switch between winning and loosing the game , a trial war has already happened.
                 ut in this war there is only peace at the end.
                <br><br>
                <li>
                    Comedy or Acting out an emotion reaches to places <b>where "WORDS" dared to go .</b> <br> 
                    <br>Charlie Chaplin , Rowan Atkinson aka (Mr Bean) have been live examples in entertaining a pan audience , which was almost an immpossible task until then.
                    As they saying goes :<i>"Its always impossible until its done".</i> <br>
                  <br>  Don't forget the fact that these two actors barely spoke in their entire acting career. Again the art of acting is prolific over words. 
                </li>

        <h3 class="head2"> 2) Communication beyond <div class="specific">SPECIES</div></h3><br>
        <p>This level of communication is that which goes even beyond language. .
            It is between two different species completely different in their physical and mental form
            <br>
            Even something as primordial as ART fails to reach this inaccessible location.
            <br>
            This is accomplished by something very simple , as well as special.
            Here the aspect of CARING comes to picture.
            </p>
        <h4>CARING:- </h4>
         <div class="definition">
              To devout oneself to another's wellbeing in any form possible.
         
    </div>
        <p>
          <b> MODES :-</b> 

<ul>
            <li> <b> Music</b>  if you thought was just an art form , you're mistaken 
            <br>The essence of music can be felt by anything with life. .
            <br>
            Music has shown to improve plant growth and even influence 
            animal behavior in many unexpected positive ways <br>
            <br>It has unexplainable significance towards the aspect of caring 
             because its not just known , but confirmed by its ability to heal .
              <br>
            If you assumed it heals only the mental strata of a living object , you're once again mistaken
            as it has accelerated even physical healing :)<br>
            <br>
            Thy affirming the "Caring aspect" in the process of well-wishing that which is living
            (may it be plants seeing a jumped growth , or a fruit ripening quick , or a buffalo producing more milk , or a person healing from miseries )
        </li>
        <br>
        <img src="./assets/music.jpeg" alt=""><br><br>
<br>
<br> <li>
           <b>FOOD  and FEEDING</b>   <br><br>
 This shares Equal or more Credit towards the aspect of care compared to music .
<br>
 They say a dog is a man's best friend, but i'd like to say a dog is its feeder's best friend .
 A dog is loyal to who feeds it,not just a dog but sometimes even a hungry lion has reverence
 to the zookeeper who feeds it .</li>
<br>
<li>
 The action of providing a Meal is the highest level of service or care one can do to another.
 <br>
 Though you may think providing food is a one way transaction . . <br>
 It isn't :)</li>
 <br>
 <br>
    <img src="./assets/elephant.jpeg" alt="">
    <br><br>
    <li>
 Those you made happy by providing food shall ever remain your well-wisher almost without them even realising it.
 I guess you know what happens after that <br>
 As the author of "Alchemist" says : <br> 
 <i></i>
  "When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it "
  So somebody blessing you for your service,is a part of the universe already on your side :)
  <br>
  <br>
  Such things are incomprehensible to those who trust just the words from a mouth .

    <article>
        <h3 class="head3"> 3) Communication beyond<div class="specific">ILLUSION</div></h3><br>
        <p>This is a level that's only visible with persistence effort to communicate 
            Not just that it's also the most essential form , every other level is merely superficial
            
            Its not very astonishing upon slight analysis that the greatest , most underrated but most essential
            level of communication is possible only through SILENCE
            Yes you heard it right . .</p>
        <h4>SILENCE :-</h4>
         <div class="definition">To listen . . . </div>
        <p>
            INSTANCES :
            <br><br>

<ul>
         <li>
            Amidst all chaos , there is a voice that always tries to communicate where we mostly deny it's chance. Its the voice within .  . <br>
            Just minutes of unbiased observation of the voice within gives
            the direction of definite , away from addictions and temporary state of disguised pleasure
            which our brain enjoys on a regular basis.
            <br>
            It also reveals to the listener the ignorance that was present to listen to it
         </li>  
           
<br>
<br>
     <img src="./assets/bhudda.jpeg" alt="">
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
           
           <li> To allow the voice to speak , one has to listen to it
            For one to listen , one has to remain silent and observe. <br>
            Once there is clear communication by silence within oneself , every other layer and level
            of communication is a cakewalk . <br><br>
            A simple level of miscommunication because of the momentary illusions can and has put an end to many relationships.  <br>
            These illusions test a man throughout life,to see his true potential and learning from an event.
            <br>
            At the same time if one keeps all illusions away and takes a vulnerable position to get to good terms by speaking from within,that even if a failed attempt may seem the right thing to have done
            since one listened to oneself.
            <br>
            As the wise saying goes <br>
            <i>"A man may win all arguements to keep his pride at high, but in the end he looses to himself"</i>
            <br>
            <br><br>
            <img src="./assets/hand.jpeg" alt="">
            <br><br>

            As i mentioned earlier,you need to listen . .  <br>but to whom ? is something one should <b></b>ask oneself.<br>
            People say there are so many question that do not have an answer.
            <br> <br>
            I must say <B>"There are so many answers which haven't been asked the right questions"</B> 
            Silence helps one observe oneself,it reveals to a person the source of influence of his/her actions. <br><br>
            Actions are happening and so are the results of actions,but due to noise from the external,the clarity of the superior call from inside diminishes. <br> <br>
            One <b>forgets the source or influence </b>of one's actions. <br> <br>
            Mind me that it isn't wrong to listen to others and follow them your entire journey,but also remember that your actions are now the <b> same as a puppet.</b> <br>
            Your controllers as any influence but you. <br>

             <br>
            <i> To be silent is to listen,to listen is to become aware of oneself.</i>
    
            <br>
            An analogy could be the sun's silent but powerful presence. <br>
            Like a crystal under a X-ray study or a black-body radiation or just a simple mirror, they reflect/radiate only what shines upon it.
            <br>
           Similarly, what you radiate or reflect is exactly what's within. <br>
           Its finally time to clear the trash that's clogged :)

            <br> <br>
          Let this be your most prominet level of communication.
        <br>
        All illusions soon disappear and the <b>pieces of the puzzle</b> are in a hand's reach once you master this.
